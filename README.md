# siakad_mantika
An academic information system built on Native PHP


//// Pre-Setup ////
Set-up the database. I put the all the SQLs (Tables and some sample data) in 'ta_siak_mantika.sql'. All you need to do is RUN the commands in MySQL or any database platform you use for your project. 

NOTE : Some lines might need modification due to the database platform.

//// Setup Guide ////
Once you download it...

--> If you use XAMPP :
    1. Extract the files and put it under one folder (ex. : the folder name is "siak_mantika")
    2. Move the file to your '../xampp/htdocs' program file (usually in "C:/xampp/htdocs/...", but if you install it elsewhere, then put it there)
    3. Start the xampp and run the apache
    4. Open a browser
    5. Go to the 'localhost/(folder_name)'. Subtitute the (folder_name) with the folder name of the project you just moved in
    6. Once you're inside the login screen, you can try to login using any username listed on the 'tb_admin', 'tb_pelajar', 'tb_orangtua', or 'tb_pengajar'
    7. Enjoy the exploration!
